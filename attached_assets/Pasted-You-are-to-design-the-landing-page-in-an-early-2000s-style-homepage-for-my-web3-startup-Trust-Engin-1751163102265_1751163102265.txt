You are to design the landing page in an early-2000s style homepage for my web3 startup, Trust Engine.

––––  Brand  ––––
• Tone → “protocol DAO”: confident, academic, hacker-minimal.
• Palette → monochrome (#000, #111, #fff); one accent (#00FFB3) for links & CTA.
• Typography →  
  - Headlines: “IBM Plex Serif” 36/44/52px.  
  - Body: “IBM Plex Sans” 18px, 1.6 line-height.  
  - All caps section tags in 12px monospace (#888).

––––  Layout  ––––
1. Full-width, single scroll page.  
2. Top block = ASCII frog watermark (in light grey, 30 % opacity) floated right.  
3. Directly below: big **“Trust Engine - Zero-Knowledge Provenance Stamp on Digital Assets”** heading, date stamp, version.  
4. Table-of-Contents side column (sticky) with anchor links:

––––  Interaction  ––––
• Anchor-jump on TOC click.  
• Snappy-scroll behaviour  
• Highlight active TOC item based on scroll position.

––––  Aesthetic flourishes  ––––
• Each section title prefixed with a tiny ascii diamond “✦”.  
• Subtle vertical grid (light 1 px stripes every 64 px) behind body for retro feel
• `<code>` blocks in 90 % black background, green text (#00FF75) to evoke terminal.
